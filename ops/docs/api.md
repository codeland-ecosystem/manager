## Routes

### Execute Code Once on a trow-away Runner

- **POST `/api/v1/runner/run`**

  Execute a code snippet once on a runner. Once the code is done executing, the
  runner will be destroyed for ever!

  **Request Body:**
  - `code` (string): The code snippet to execute.

  **Query Parameters:**
  - `time` (integer, optional): Maximum execution time in seconds (default is 60 seconds).

  **Response:**
  - `res` (string): The result of the code execution in base64 format.

  **Error Codes:**
  - 503: RunnerNotAvailable - No fresh runners are available at this time.
  - 498: runnerTimedOut - The execution time exceeded the specified timeout.
  - 400: runnerExecutionFailed - Execution on the runner failed for unknown reasons.

  This route allows you to execute code quickly on a runner without reusing the runner for subsequent requests. The runner is destroyed after execution to ensure a fresh runner for each request.

  **Sample Request:**
  ```json
  {
    "code": "console.log('Hello, CodeLand!');"
  }

  **Sample Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "res": "SGVsbG8sIENvZGVMYW5kIQ=="
  }
  ```

### Create a New Runner

  - `runner` (string): The name of the new runner.

  **Error Codes:**
  - 503: RunnerNotAvailable - No fresh runners are available at this time.

  **Sample Request:**
  ```json
  {
