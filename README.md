## Project Overview

### Components

- **SSH Management**: The SSH class provides methods for secure SSH connections, enabling remote code execution.

- **LXC Container Management**: The LXC class facilitates the creation, management, and interaction with Linux containers (LXC) for code execution.

- **CodeLand Worker**: The CodeLandWorker class is the heart of the system, responsible for creating and managing runners, monitoring memory usage, and executing code on runners.

- **API**: The API allows you to interact with the CodeLand Worker, providing endpoints to retrieve runner information, execute code, and manage runner resources.
